# MagicPrompt Projects

This is a description card for a project hosted on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/Gustavosta) called "MagicPrompt", created by me.

<div id="magicprompt-dall-e-2"><h2><a href="https://huggingface.co/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Dalle">MagicPrompt - Dall-E 2</a></h2></div><br>

This is a model from the MagicPrompt series of models, which are [GPT-2](https://huggingface.co/gpt2) models intended to generate prompt texts for imaging AIs, in this case: [Dall-E 2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/).

<br>

### üñºÔ∏è Here's an example:
<br>

<br>

This model was trained with a set of about 26k of data filtered and extracted from various places such as: [The Web Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://labs.openai.com/s/*), [The SubReddit for Dall-E 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/dalle2) and [dalle2.gallery](https://dalle2.gallery/#search). This may be a relatively small dataset, but we have to consider that Dall-E 2 is a closed service and we only have prompts from people who share it and have access to the service, for now. The set was trained with about 40,000 steps and I have plans to improve the model if possible.

If you want to test the model with a demo, you can go to: "[spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Dalle](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gustavosta/MagicPrompt-Dalle)".

<br>

This model was trained with 150,000 steps and a set of about 80,000 data filtered and extracted from the image finder for Stable Diffusion: "[Lexica.art](https://lexica.art/)". It was a little difficult to extract the data, since the search engine still doesn't have a public API without being protected by cloudflare, but if you want to take a look at the original dataset, you can have a look here: [datasets/Gustavosta/Stable-Diffusion-Prompts](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Gustavosta/Stable-Diffusion-Prompts).
